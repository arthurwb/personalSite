                </div>
                <p>Through academic and personal projects I have gained skills in client-side development. These skills give me the ability to work with clients and customers to design systems that meet and exceed their expectations.</p>
                <p><b>HTML/CSS</b>: From foundational knowledge to applied practice I have honed my skills in developing easy-to-understand and adaptable HTML and CSS.</p>
                <p><b>JavaScript</b>: After gaining a foundational understanding of JavaScript, I have continued to learn more and more about the various applications of JavaScript. Through these experiences, I have gained knowledge of various libraries and frameworks. </p>

                </div>
                    <p>At the beginning of my educational career, I learned much about various object-oriented programming languages, from Java to C# to C. Learning these languages and practicing their application has given me a strong understanding of various server-side languages and functions.</p>
                    <p><b>Node.js</b>: Originally through extreme trial and error, I taught myself the basics of Node.js and pushed to create an entire application using this as its base. I am now currently seeking to further my understanding and apply this skill to more projects.</p>
                    <p><b>PHP</b>: As the first web server-side programming language that I have learned, this language has become something of a baseline for my understanding of server-side technologies. Through creating various applications making use of PHP I have learned database integration, session controls, server-side processing, and API calls.</p>
                    <p><b>SQL</b>: Having taken three semester-long courses on database design and programming I am confident in my abilities to design and query various SQL-based databases.</p>

                </div>
                <p>In both my high school and college education I have gained various skills in design, from user-centered UX development to foundational graphic design. These skills have been built upon along with other development skills as the ability to create unique assets and use design-centered tools in the development process has often resulted in a more polished final product.</p>
                <p><b>Adobe Products</b>: In various courses and in personal exploration I have gained knowledge and skills in the primary adobe suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere Pro) as well as specific web design tools such as Dreamweaver. Along with this, I have become familiar with various open-source equivalents to these products (Gimp, Inkscape, OpenShot Editor, Audacity).</p>

                    <p>From high school in concert, marching, and jazz band, to more recently, I have always loved listening to and playing music. Craig's Limit is the band that I helped co-found and am excited to soon be in a position where I can once again play music live.</p>

                    <p>Norse Code Radio is the local radio club on campus at NKU. While I originally joined the club to help them with their website, recently I have taken a more direct role and will soon be hosting my own radio hour called WNCR.</p>

                    <p>While this may seem obvious, I take great enjoyment in programming. The feeling of accomplishment that I get when I finish a project is what pushes me to become a better programmer and to build upon the skills that I have gained in the classroom.</p>

                    <p>Dungeons and Dragons are one of my greatest loves. I started the summer before my freshman year in high school and have been playing consistently every week since then. As the dungeon master, I have taken a leadership role in the group and have gained relevant skills from this role.</p>

                    <p>In recent history, it is hard to find anyone who does not enjoy playing video games, as it is one of the largest hobbies in the world. As with many others, I love the stories and worlds that are created through video games and this hobby could likely tie to my original interest in programming.</p>

                    <p>Writing is a hobby that spawned out of my playing Dungeons and Dragons. Through writing notes and designing stories I found that I really quite enjoy writing and creating narratives, and while I am no expert in novel writing, being a professional writer is a job I often fantasize about.</p>
